# create-react-app

An easy way to get started with React v18.

This was created since it took so long for me to get started
again after working with React v16.

This app uses my preferences, especially in ESLint.
Feel free to update them.

## Scripts

### `yarn dev`

Launches development mode in webpack.

Open [http:localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
to view it in your prefered browser.

You can change the port in [webpack config](./webpack.config.json).

### `yarn build`

Builds the production build of this app.

### `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint and provides errors and warnings to be fixed.

## Notes

- This app uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The recommended alternative this is
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) but I have no experience with it.
- This app uses yarn as I do not like npm or npx.
Use that at your own risk.
- ESLint
  - 0: none
  - 1: warn
  - 2: error

## Disclaimer

The [commands](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) `npx create-react-app` and `yarn create react-app` and the React framework are created by the React devs. Creating my React applications would not be possible without them.
